# Prediction-model
using arima to train and predict future values 

•	Downloaded weather data from Historical Hourly Weather Data 2012-2017 | Kaggle and saved locally as csv file 
•	Used python in data cleaning proceedure (ie removed unwanted colums, dropped empty rows, removed duplicates and standardized outliners)
•	Read the data in excel using only the temperature and hour parameters and I indexed the hour column
•	I plot the temperature to time graph using the first half of the dataset
•	Using sqlearn library and the arima model I developed a training algorythm using the initial first half of the data set to train and predict the second half 
•	The model responded with numerous running with a minimal rms.
