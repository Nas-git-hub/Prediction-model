# Prediction-model
using arima to train and predict future values 
* Downloaded weather data from Historical Hourly Weather Data 2012-2017	Kaggle and saved locally as csv file
* Used python in data cleaning proceedure (ie removed unwanted colums, dropped empty rows, removed duplicates and standardized outliners)
* Read the data in excel using only the temperature and hour parameters and I indexed the hour column
* I plot the temperature to time graph using the first half of the dataset
* Using sqlearn library and the arima model I developed a training algorythm using the initial first half of the data set to train and predict the second half
* The model responded with numerous running with a minimal rms.
